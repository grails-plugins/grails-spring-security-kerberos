== Introduction to the Spring Security Kerberos Plugin

The Kerberos plugin adds http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/[Kerberos] single sign-on support to a Grails application that uses Spring Security. It depends on the http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core[Spring Security Core plugin].

Once you have configured a Kerberos server (typically Microsoft Active Directory or MIT Kerberos) and have configured your Grails application(s) as clients, users who are have authenticated at the Kerberos server will be automatically authenticated as a user of your application(s) without requiring a password.

In addition to this document, you should read the http://docs.spring.io/spring-security-kerberos/docs/1.0.x/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Security Kerberos documentation].
